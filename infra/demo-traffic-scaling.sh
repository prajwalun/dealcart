echo "What happened:"
echo "  1. Low traffic: System maintained current capacity"
echo "  2. Medium traffic: System may have scaled up (if thresholds exceeded)"
echo "  3. High traffic: System likely scaled up to handle load"
echo "  4. Very high traffic: System scaled to maximum capacity"
echo "  5. Low traffic: System scaled down to save resources"

echo "Key Features Demonstrated:"
echo "  ✅ Real-time traffic monitoring (RPS, latency, error rate)"
echo "  ✅ Automatic scaling based on traffic patterns"
echo "  ✅ Both vertical (threads) and horizontal (instances) scaling"
echo "  ✅ Proactive scaling (scales before system overloads)"
echo "  ✅ Cost optimization (scales down when traffic decreases)"
