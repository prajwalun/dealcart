# Docker image prefix for deployment
# Copy this to EC2 as .env and update with your actual GitHub username/repo
# The IMAGE_PREFIX should match what GitHub Actions pushes to GHCR

# Example for username "johndoe" with repo "dealcart":
# IMAGE_PREFIX=ghcr.io/johndoe/dealcart

# Example for username "mycompany" with repo "dealcart-plus":
# IMAGE_PREFIX=ghcr.io/mycompany/dealcart-plus

# IMPORTANT: Use lowercase for GHCR compatibility
IMAGE_PREFIX=ghcr.io/username/dealcart
