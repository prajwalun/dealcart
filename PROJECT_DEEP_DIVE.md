# DealCart+ Project Deep-Dive Document

## Project Overview and Business Context

### What is the project?
DealCart+ is a production-ready, horizontally scalable e-commerce microservices platform that aggregates product pricing from multiple vendors in real-time. The system provides a unified API for consumers to search products, receive live pricing quotes, and complete checkout transactions across multiple vendor ecosystems. The platform simulates a real-world e-commerce aggregator like Google Shopping or PriceGrabber, where users can compare prices from different retailers for the same product.

### Why does it exist?
The core business problem DealCart+ solves is the fragmentation of e-commerce pricing data across multiple vendor platforms. In today's market, consumers must visit multiple websites to compare prices, leading to poor user experience and missed opportunities for both consumers and vendors. DealCart+ addresses this by:

- **Unifying fragmented pricing data** from multiple vendor APIs into a single, consistent interface
- **Providing real-time price comparison** with sub-250ms response times
- **Enabling seamless checkout** across vendor boundaries with distributed transaction management
- **Scaling to handle high-volume traffic** (100K+ requests) with automatic resource adjustment

### Key Users/Consumers
- **End Consumers**: E-commerce shoppers seeking price comparison and unified checkout
- **Vendor Partners**: Retailers wanting to expose their inventory through the aggregator platform
- **Business Stakeholders**: Product managers and executives requiring real-time pricing analytics
- **System Administrators**: DevOps teams managing platform scalability and reliability

### Key Metrics/Goals
- **Performance**: P95 latency ≤ 250ms, P99 latency ≤ 500ms
- **Reliability**: 99.8% success rate under sustained load
- **Scalability**: Handle 200+ RPS sustained, 500+ RPS during traffic spikes
- **Availability**: 99.9% uptime with automatic failover and recovery
- **Throughput**: Process 100K+ requests in load testing scenarios
- **Resource Efficiency**: Auto-scale from 1 to 5 instances based on traffic patterns

## Core Architecture and Data Flow

### Architectural Pattern
DealCart+ implements a **Microservices Architecture** with **Event-Driven Communication** and **Distributed Transaction Management**. The system follows the **API Gateway Pattern** for external communication and **SAGA Pattern** for distributed transaction orchestration.

### End-to-End Data Flow
**Critical Path: Product Search and Quote Request**

1. **Client Request**: User searches for "wireless headphones" via Web UI
2. **Edge Gateway**: Receives HTTP request, applies rate limiting, generates request ID
3. **Vendor Pricing Service**: 
   - Receives gRPC request with product query
   - Fan-out to multiple vendor-mock services in parallel
   - Each vendor returns product data and pricing
   - Aggregates responses and calculates best offers
4. **Response Streaming**: Edge Gateway streams results via Server-Sent Events (SSE)
5. **Client Updates**: Web UI receives real-time updates as quotes arrive

**Critical Path: Checkout Transaction**

1. **Checkout Initiation**: Client submits order with items and customer info
2. **SAGA Orchestration**: Checkout service creates distributed transaction
3. **Inventory Reservation**: Reserve items across vendor systems
4. **Pricing Calculation**: Calculate final pricing including taxes
5. **Payment Processing**: Process payment (simulated)
6. **Order Confirmation**: Confirm order and generate receipt
7. **Compensation on Failure**: If any step fails, execute compensating actions

## Deep-Dive Technology Stack Analysis

### gRPC (Google Remote Procedure Call)

**What is it?**
gRPC is a high-performance, open-source RPC framework that uses Protocol Buffers for serialization and HTTP/2 for transport. It provides type-safe, language-agnostic communication between services with built-in features like load balancing, authentication, and streaming.

**Why did we choose it?**
We chose gRPC over REST APIs for inter-service communication because:
- **Performance**: Binary serialization and HTTP/2 multiplexing provide 3-5x better performance than JSON over HTTP/1.1
- **Type Safety**: Protocol Buffers provide compile-time type checking and schema evolution
- **Streaming Support**: Built-in support for server-side streaming, essential for real-time quote updates
- **Language Agnostic**: Future services can be written in different languages while maintaining compatibility
- **Production Ready**: Built-in features like load balancing, health checking, and authentication

**How is it implemented here?**
- **Protocol Definition**: Defined in `proto/src/main/proto/` with services for pricing, checkout, and vendor APIs
- **Code Generation**: Maven protobuf plugin generates Java stubs from `.proto` files
- **Service Implementation**: Each microservice implements gRPC service interfaces
- **Client Configuration**: Uses Netty transport with `pick_first` load balancing policy
- **Streaming**: Vendor pricing service uses server-side streaming for real-time quote delivery

### SAGA Pattern (Saga Orchestration Pattern)

**What is it?**
The SAGA pattern is a distributed transaction management approach that breaks long-running transactions into a series of local transactions, each with a corresponding compensating action. Instead of using distributed locks, it ensures eventual consistency through compensation.

**Why did we choose it?**
We implemented SAGA over traditional two-phase commit because:
- **Microservices Independence**: Each service maintains its own data and business logic
- **Fault Tolerance**: Partial failures don't block the entire transaction indefinitely
- **Scalability**: No distributed locks or coordination overhead
- **Real-world Applicability**: E-commerce transactions often span multiple systems with different consistency requirements
- **Compensation Logic**: Natural fit for e-commerce operations (reserve → pay → confirm, with release/void on failure)

**How is it implemented here?**
- **Transaction Steps**: Reserve inventory → Calculate pricing → Process payment → Confirm order
- **Compensation Actions**: Release inventory → Void payment → Cancel order
- **Promise Graph**: Uses `CompletableFuture` to orchestrate async operations
- **State Management**: `OrderStatusManager` tracks transaction state and compensation requirements
- **Error Handling**: Each step has timeout and retry logic with automatic compensation on failure

### Adaptive Thread Pool (Custom Auto-scaling)

**What is it?**
An adaptive thread pool is a dynamic thread management system that automatically adjusts the number of worker threads based on real-time performance metrics, specifically P95 latency. It scales up when performance degrades and scales down when performance improves.

**Why did we choose it?**
We implemented custom adaptive scaling over static thread pools because:
- **Performance Optimization**: Automatically adjusts to traffic patterns without manual intervention
- **Resource Efficiency**: Reduces thread overhead during low-traffic periods
- **Latency Control**: Maintains consistent response times under varying load
- **Cost Optimization**: Better resource utilization in cloud environments
- **Production Readiness**: Real-world systems require dynamic resource allocation

**How is it implemented here?**
- **Metrics Collection**: Tracks P95 latency over a sliding window (2000 samples)
- **Scaling Logic**: Increases threads when P95 > 250ms, decreases when P95 < 200ms
- **Bounded Queue**: Uses `LinkedBlockingQueue(2048)` to prevent unbounded memory growth
- **Cooldown Period**: 20-second cooldown between scaling decisions to prevent flapping
- **Configuration**: Environment-driven parameters (min=8, max=64, step=8)

### Docker Compose with Horizontal Scaling

**What is it?**
Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. It uses YAML files to configure services, networks, and volumes, enabling easy orchestration of microservices with built-in scaling capabilities.

**Why did we choose it?**
We chose Docker Compose over Kubernetes for this project because:
- **Simplicity**: Easier to understand and maintain for a small team
- **Local Development**: Seamless development-to-production parity
- **Built-in Scaling**: Native support for service replicas without complex orchestration
- **Resource Efficiency**: Lower overhead than full Kubernetes cluster
- **Learning Curve**: Team can focus on application logic rather than infrastructure complexity

**How is it implemented here?**
- **Service Definitions**: Each microservice defined with build context and environment variables
- **Horizontal Scaling**: `deploy.replicas` configuration for vendor-pricing (3) and edge-gateway (2)
- **Load Balancing**: Caddy reverse proxy distributes traffic across replicas
- **Health Checks**: Built-in health monitoring for service availability
- **Networking**: Custom Docker network for service discovery and communication

### Server-Sent Events (SSE)

**What is it?**
Server-Sent Events is a web standard that allows a server to push data to a client over a single HTTP connection. Unlike WebSockets, SSE is unidirectional (server-to-client) and automatically handles reconnection.

**Why did we choose it?**
We chose SSE over WebSockets or polling because:
- **Simplicity**: Easier to implement than bidirectional WebSocket communication
- **Automatic Reconnection**: Built-in client-side reconnection handling
- **HTTP Compatibility**: Works through firewalls and proxies without special configuration
- **Real-time Updates**: Perfect for streaming quote updates as they arrive
- **Resource Efficiency**: Lower overhead than maintaining persistent WebSocket connections

**How is it implemented here?**
- **Edge Gateway**: Spring Boot controller with `@GetMapping(produces = "text/event-stream")`
- **Streaming Response**: Returns `SseEmitter` for real-time quote delivery
- **Event Format**: Standard SSE format with `data:` prefix and `\n\n` delimiters
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of client disconnections and network issues
- **Caddy Configuration**: `flush_interval -1` ensures immediate streaming without buffering

### Protocol Buffers (protobuf)

**What is it?**
Protocol Buffers is a language-neutral, platform-neutral, extensible mechanism for serializing structured data. It's smaller, faster, and simpler than XML, and provides strong typing and schema evolution.

**Why did we choose it?**
We chose Protocol Buffers over JSON for service communication because:
- **Performance**: 3-10x smaller payload size and faster serialization/deserialization
- **Type Safety**: Compile-time type checking prevents runtime errors
- **Schema Evolution**: Backward and forward compatibility for API versioning
- **Code Generation**: Automatic generation of client/server code in multiple languages
- **gRPC Integration**: Native support in gRPC for high-performance RPC calls

**How is it implemented here?**
- **Schema Definition**: Defined in `proto/src/main/proto/` with services for pricing, checkout, and vendor APIs
- **Maven Integration**: `protobuf-maven-plugin` generates Java classes during build
- **Version Management**: Centralized version management in parent POM
- **Service Definitions**: Clear separation between request/response messages and service interfaces
