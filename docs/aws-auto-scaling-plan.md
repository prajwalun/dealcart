# AWS Auto-Scaling for Flash Sales

## The Problem: Manual vs Automatic Scaling

### Current (Manual):
```bash
# Flash sale starts → You manually run:
docker compose up -d --scale vendor-pricing=5
# Takes 2-3 minutes to scale up
# Traffic spike already passed!
```

### AWS Solution (Automatic):
```
Flash sale starts → CloudWatch detects high CPU/latency
→ Auto Scaling Group adds instances in 30 seconds
→ Load Balancer routes traffic to new instances
→ System handles 10x traffic automatically
```

## AWS Architecture for Auto-Scaling

### 1. Application Load Balancer (ALB)
```
Internet → ALB → Target Groups
                ├─ vendor-pricing-1 (healthy)
                ├─ vendor-pricing-2 (healthy)  
                ├─ vendor-pricing-3 (healthy)
                └─ vendor-pricing-N (auto-added)
```

### 2. Auto Scaling Group (ASG)
```yaml
MinSize: 2
MaxSize: 20
DesiredCapacity: 3

ScaleUp Triggers:
  - CPU > 70% for 2 minutes → Add 2 instances
  - ResponseTime > 500ms for 1 minute → Add 3 instances
  - Custom metric: QueueDepth > 100 → Add 1 instance

ScaleDown Triggers:
  - CPU < 30% for 5 minutes → Remove 1 instance
  - ResponseTime < 200ms for 10 minutes → Remove 1 instance
```

### 3. CloudWatch Metrics
```yaml
Custom Metrics:
  - P95Latency (from each instance)
  - QueueDepth (from vendor-pricing)
  - RequestRate (from ALB)
  - ErrorRate (from ALB)
```

## Scaling Response Timeline

### Flash Sale Scenario (500 users, 10 requests each):

```
T+0s:   Normal traffic (50 RPS)
        → 3 instances, 8 threads each = 24 threads
        → P95: 200ms ✅

T+30s:  Flash sale starts (500 users hit site)
        → Traffic jumps to 200 RPS
        → P95 rises to 400ms
        → CloudWatch alarm triggers

T+60s:  Auto Scaling Group adds 2 instances
        → Now 5 instances, 8 threads each = 40 threads
        → P95 drops to 300ms

T+90s:  Traffic still high (300 RPS)
        → Each instance autoscales to 16 threads
        → Now 5 instances × 16 threads = 80 threads
        → P95 drops to 250ms ✅

T+120s: Peak traffic (400 RPS)
        → ASG adds 3 more instances (8 total)
        → 8 instances × 16 threads = 128 threads
        → P95 stays at 250ms ✅

T+300s: Traffic decreases (150 RPS)
        → ASG removes 3 instances (5 remaining)
        → P95 stays at 200ms ✅

T+600s: Back to normal (50 RPS)
        → ASG removes 2 instances (3 remaining)
        → Each instance scales down to 8 threads
        → P95 back to 200ms ✅
```

**Total Response Time: 60 seconds from spike to scaling**

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Create AWS Infrastructure
```bash
# 1. Create VPC, subnets, security groups
# 2. Launch EC2 instances with Docker
# 3. Create Application Load Balancer
# 4. Create Auto Scaling Group
# 5. Set up CloudWatch alarms
```

### Step 2: Add Custom Metrics
```java
// In vendor-pricing service
@RestController
public class MetricsController {
    
    @GetMapping("/metrics")
    public Map<String, Object> getMetrics() {
        return Map.of(
            "p95Latency", adaptivePool.getCurrentP95(),
            "queueDepth", adaptivePool.getQueueSize(),
            "activeThreads", adaptivePool.getActiveThreads(),
            "totalRequests", requestCounter.get()
        );
    }
}
```

### Step 3: CloudWatch Alarms
```yaml
ScaleUpAlarm:
  MetricName: P95Latency
  Threshold: 500
  ComparisonOperator: GreaterThanThreshold
  EvaluationPeriods: 2
  Actions: [scale-up-policy]

ScaleDownAlarm:
  MetricName: P95Latency  
  Threshold: 200
  ComparisonOperator: LessThanThreshold
  EvaluationPeriods: 5
  Actions: [scale-down-policy]
```

### Step 4: Auto Scaling Policies
```yaml
ScaleUpPolicy:
  AdjustmentType: ChangeInCapacity
  ScalingAdjustment: 2
  Cooldown: 300

ScaleDownPolicy:
  AdjustmentType: ChangeInCapacity
  ScalingAdjustment: -1
  Cooldown: 600
```

## Expected Performance Under Flash Sale

### With Auto-Scaling (AWS):
```
Peak Users: 500 concurrent
Peak RPS: 400-500 RPS
Instances: 8-10 (auto-scaled)
Total Threads: 128-160
P95 Latency: 250-400ms
Success Rate: 99.5%+
Response Time: 60 seconds to scale
```

### Without Auto-Scaling (Current):
```
Peak Users: 500 concurrent  
Peak RPS: 400-500 RPS
Instances: 3 (fixed)
Total Threads: 48-96
P95 Latency: 1000-2000ms
Success Rate: 95-98%
Response Time: Manual (5+ minutes)
```

## Cost Analysis

### AWS Costs (US East):
```
EC2 t3.medium (2 vCPU, 4GB RAM):
  - Normal: 3 instances × $0.0416/hour = $0.125/hour
  - Flash sale: 8 instances × $0.0416/hour = $0.333/hour
  - Peak cost: +$0.208/hour during spike

ALB: $0.0225 per ALB-hour + $0.008 per LCU-hour
CloudWatch: $0.30 per metric per month
Auto Scaling: Free

Total additional cost during flash sale: ~$0.25/hour
```

### Revenue Protection:
```
Without auto-scaling: 5% of customers can't complete purchase
With auto-scaling: 0.5% of customers can't complete purchase
Difference: 4.5% more successful transactions

If flash sale generates $10,000 revenue:
- Lost revenue without scaling: $450
- AWS scaling cost: $0.25
- Net benefit: $449.75
```

## Demo Script for Portfolio

### 1. Show Current Manual Scaling:
```bash
# Start with 1 instance
docker compose up -d --scale vendor-pricing=1

# Run spike test (simulates flash sale)
./loadtest/run-spike-test.sh

# Show: System struggles, high latency
```

### 2. Show Manual Scale-Up:
```bash
# Scale up during "flash sale"
docker compose up -d --scale vendor-pricing=5

# Run same test again
./loadtest/run-spike-test.sh

# Show: Much better performance
```

### 3. Explain AWS Auto-Scaling:
```bash
# Show the AWS architecture diagram
# Explain: "This would happen automatically in 60 seconds"
# Show: CloudWatch alarms, ASG policies
```

## Key Points for Interview

### What You Can Say:

> "DealCart+ currently uses manual horizontal scaling with Docker Compose. For production, I'd implement AWS Auto Scaling Groups that automatically detect traffic spikes via CloudWatch metrics and scale from 3 to 10+ instances in under 60 seconds. This handles flash sales with 500+ concurrent users while maintaining sub-second response times."

### Technical Details:
- **Vertical scaling**: Thread pools (8-64 threads per instance)
- **Horizontal scaling**: Auto Scaling Groups (3-20 instances)
- **Load balancing**: Application Load Balancer with health checks
- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch custom metrics (P95, queue depth, error rate)
- **Response time**: 60 seconds from spike detection to new instances

### Business Impact:
- **Revenue protection**: 4.5% more successful transactions during spikes
- **Cost efficiency**: Only pay for extra capacity during traffic spikes
- **User experience**: Consistent performance even during flash sales
- **Reliability**: 99.5%+ success rate under extreme load

2. **Add custom metrics endpoint** to vendor-pricing
3. **Set up CloudWatch alarms** and scaling policies
4. **Test auto-scaling** with simulated flash sale
