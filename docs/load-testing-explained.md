# Load Testing Explained - What We Tested

This document clarifies what our load tests actually measured and how they relate to real-world traffic.

---

## What We Tested: 100K Requests

### Configuration:
```
50 concurrent threads (users)
2,000 loops per thread
= 100,000 total requests
Duration: 22 minutes 28 seconds
Throughput: 74.2 requests/second
```

### Visual Representation:
```
Time →  0s     5min    10min   15min   20min   22min
        |-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
Load:   [====== 50 concurrent users ============]
        
Requests: 100,000 total (distributed over 22 minutes)
```

### What This Means:
- **50 people** shopping simultaneously
- Each person makes **2,000 API calls** (one after another)
- Total: **100K requests** over time
- **NOT 100K simultaneous requests**

## Real E-Commerce Traffic Comparisons

### Small E-Commerce Site (Startup):
- **Normal traffic:** 10-50 RPS
- **Peak traffic:** 100-200 RPS
- **Daily requests:** ~5-10 million
- **Our test:** ✅ **Matches this tier** (74 RPS sustained)

### Medium E-Commerce Site:
- **Normal traffic:** 200-1,000 RPS
- **Peak traffic:** 2,000-5,000 RPS
- **Daily requests:** ~50-100 million
- **To test this:** Need 200-300 concurrent threads

### Large E-Commerce Site (Amazon scale):
- **Normal traffic:** 50,000+ RPS
- **Peak traffic:** 200,000+ RPS
- **Daily requests:** Billions
- **To test this:** Need distributed testing infrastructure

## Types of Load Tests

### 1. Endurance Test (What We Did) ✅
**Purpose:** Verify system stays stable over time

```
Load: Moderate (50-100 concurrent users)
Duration: Long (10-30 minutes)
Goal: No memory leaks, no degradation
Our Result: ✅ P95 stable at 836ms for 22 minutes
```

### 2. Spike Test (Recommended Next)
**Purpose:** Test sudden traffic increase

```
Load: Low → High → Low
Example: 10 users → 500 users → 10 users
Duration: 5-10 minutes
Goal: System scales up quickly and recovers
```

### 3. Stress Test
**Purpose:** Find breaking point

```
Load: Increase until system fails
Example: 50 → 100 → 200 → 500 → 1000 users
Goal: Identify maximum capacity
```

### 4. Volume Test (What We Did) ✅
**Purpose:** Handle large total volume

```
Load: 100K, 500K, 1M total requests
Goal: System processes large volumes successfully
Our Result: ✅ 100K requests, 99.82% success
```

## Horizontal Scaling - How It Works

### Current: Vertical Scaling Only
```
vendor-pricing (1 instance)
    ↓
Threads: 8 → 16 → 24 → 32 → 64
    ↓
Max capacity: ~100-150 RPS per instance
```

**Limitation:** Single instance max out at 64 threads

---

### With Horizontal Scaling:

```
Traffic: 100 RPS
    ↓
Load Balancer
    ↓
vendor-pricing-1 (16 threads) ← handles ~60 RPS
    
---

Traffic increases to 300 RPS
    ↓
Load Balancer (detects high latency)
    ↓
├─ vendor-pricing-1 (32 threads) ← ~100 RPS
├─ vendor-pricing-2 (32 threads) ← ~100 RPS  [AUTO-SPAWNED]
└─ vendor-pricing-3 (32 threads) ← ~100 RPS  [AUTO-SPAWNED]

Total capacity: 300+ RPS
```

**Benefits:**
- Each instance handles ~100-150 RPS max
- Can scale to 10+ instances (1,000+ RPS)
- Fault tolerant (one instance crashes, others continue)
- Better resource utilization

## Best Ways to Showcase This Project

### For Portfolio / Resume:

**Current Metrics You Can Claim:**
```
✅ "Handled 100,000+ requests with 99.8% success rate"
✅ "Adaptive thread pool autoscaling (8-64 threads based on P95 latency)"
✅ "gRPC microservices with real-time SSE streaming"
✅ "Promise-graph checkout with SAGA compensations"
✅ "Load tested with JMeter at 74 RPS sustained"
✅ "Sub-second latency (P95: 836ms) under sustained load"
```

### Quick Wins to Add (30-60 min each):

**1. Spike Test (Shows Autoscaling in Action)** ⭐️⭐️⭐️
```
Create test: 50 → 500 → 50 concurrent users
Show: Autoscaler scales 8→16→32→64 threads
Time: 30 minutes to implement
Impact: HIGH - visually shows autoscaling working
```

**2. Docker Compose Horizontal Scaling** ⭐️⭐️
```
Add: docker compose up -d --scale vendor-pricing=3
Show: 3 instances handling traffic together
Time: 30 minutes
Impact: MEDIUM - shows understanding of scaling
```

**3. Metrics Dashboard (Grafana)** ⭐️⭐️⭐️
```
Add: Prometheus + Grafana
Show: Live graphs of thread count, RPS, latency
Time: 60 minutes
Impact: HIGH - looks very professional
```

**4. README with Architecture Diagram** ⭐️⭐️⭐️
```
Add: Detailed README with diagrams, metrics, screenshots
Time: 30 minutes
Impact: HIGH - helps recruiters understand the project
```

## Realistic Test Scenarios for Demo

### Demo 1: Normal Traffic (What We Have)
```
50 concurrent users
100K total requests
Shows: System handles sustained load
```

### Demo 2: Flash Sale Spike (Recommended)
```
Ramp: 10 → 500 → 10 users over 10 minutes
Shows: Autoscaling responds to traffic spike
Logs: Watch threads scale 8→16→32→48→64→48→32→16→8
```

### Demo 3: Multi-Instance (Optional)
```
3 vendor-pricing instances
300 concurrent users
Shows: Horizontal scaling distributes load
```
