### High-Demand Electronics

- `sku-airpods`: 15,000 units
- `sku-mouse`: 18,000 units
- `sku-keyboard`: 12,000 units
- `sku-watch`: 8,000 units

- **Unknown SKUs**: 100,000 units (default fallback for load testing)

## JMeter Load Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Popular Electronics Mix
Simulates Black Friday traffic with high-demand electronics:
```
30% - sku-iphone
20% - sku-airpods
15% - sku-laptop
15% - sku-keyboard
10% - sku-mouse
10% - sku-headphones
```

### Scenario 2: Diverse Product Mix
Balanced mix across all categories:
```
20% - Electronics (laptop, iphone, airpods)
20% - Home & Kitchen (blender, coffee, microwave)
20% - Sports & Outdoors (bike, yoga-mat, backpack)
20% - Clothing (jacket, shoes, jeans)
20% - Books & Toys (book, lego, puzzle)
```

### Scenario 3: High-Value Items
Tests system under expensive product load:
```
25% - macbook ($1,299)
25% - drone ($1,199)
25% - camera ($899)
25% - treadmill ($599)
```

### Scenario 4: Budget Items
Tests high-volume, low-value transactions:
```
30% - book ($19.99)
25% - shirt ($29)
20% - puzzle ($19.99)
15% - yoga-mat ($29)
10% - ebook ($9.99)
```

## Product ID Formats

The system supports multiple product ID formats:

1. **SKU Format**: `sku-<product-name>`
   - Example: `sku-laptop`, `sku-headphones`
   - Maps directly to inventory

2. **Keyword Format**: `<product-name>`
   - Example: `laptop`, `headphones`
   - Fuzzy matches to catalog (contains check)

3. **Hash-based**: Any unique ID
   - Example: `prod-12345`, `item-abc`
   - Generates price from hash ($10-$300)

---

## Vendor Pricing Variance

Each vendor applies a **Â±15% variance** to catalog prices to simulate competitive pricing:

**Example: Laptop ($899 base)**
- Amazon (amz): $850 (5% below base)
- Best Buy (bb): $925 (3% above base)

This creates realistic "best price" scenarios for testing.

---

## Latency Simulation

Vendor responses follow a realistic latency distribution:
- **p50**: ~80ms
- **p95**: ~220ms
- **Max**: 500ms (capped)

Uses exponential distribution with 20ms base latency.

---

## Stock Levels for Load Testing

Total available inventory supports **100K+ checkout requests**:

| Category       | Total Units Available |
|----------------|-----------------------|
| Electronics    | ~100,000              |
| Home & Kitchen | ~50,000               |
| Sports         | ~40,000               |
| Clothing       | ~50,000               |
| Books/Toys     | ~50,000               |
| **Total**      | **~290,000 units**    |

**Unknown products default to 100,000 units** to prevent inventory failures during stress tests.

## Testing Recommendations

### Quick Smoke Test (1 minute)
```bash
# Test a few popular products
curl "http://localhost/api/search?q=laptop"
curl "http://localhost/api/search?q=headphones"
curl "http://localhost/api/search?q=book"
```

### JMeter Thread Groups
- **Ramp-up**: 5 minutes to 1000 threads
- **Sustained**: 1000 threads for 15 minutes
- **Product mix**: Use CSV data set with 50+ products
- **Think time**: 1-3 seconds between requests

### Expected Results
- **Search latency (p95)**: <500ms
- **Checkout latency (p95)**: <2s
- **Success rate**: >99%
- **Inventory conflicts**: <0.1%

## Mock Data Philosophy

This catalog balances:
1. **Realism**: Actual product names and realistic prices
2. **Variety**: 50+ products across 8 categories
3. **Scalability**: 290K+ inventory for 100K test requests
4. **Determinism**: Same product always gets similar price across vendors
5. **Flexibility**: Unknown products still work (hash-based pricing)

Perfect for demos, load testing, and portfolio showcasing! ðŸš€
